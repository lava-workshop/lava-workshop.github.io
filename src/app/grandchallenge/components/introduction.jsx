                On one hand, there has been significant advancement in AI and machine learning, particularly with the development of large language models like GPT recently. These models have demonstrated their prowess in harnessing extensive text data to achieve remarkable performance across various natural language understanding tasks. As a result, there is a growing interest in expanding these capabilities to encompass additional modalities such as images, audios, and videos, giving rise to large vision-language models (LVLMs) like GPT-V. In addition, LVLMs hold immense promise across a spectrum of applications including healthcare, education, entertainment, transportation, finance.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                On the other hand, while the potential of LVLMs to achieve comprehensive understanding of multimodal content is undeniable, the landscape of research in this domain presents notable challenges. These include issues such as optimizing training methodologies, devising comprehensive evaluation techniques, and addressing biases inherent in LVLMs.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                We believe the proposed workshop will help demonstrate the benefits and possibilities of LVLMs and provide insights for tackling some of the challenges mentioned above.
